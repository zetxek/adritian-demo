This is where you can highlight a bit over your experience. Years of total experience, specialization, etc.

The content in this intro comes from the `i18n/en.yaml` file, in the `experience_description` item.

The content for each experience item (that you can click on the left) is defined in the `content/experience` folder, with one content item per experience, as in `job-1.md`, `job-2.md`, etc.

The content (text and URL) for the buttons below (where you can add links) comes from the translation file, `i18n/en.yaml`, in the `experience_button`, `experience_button_url`, `experience_button2`, `experience_button2_url`, `experience_button3`, `experience_button3_url` items.
