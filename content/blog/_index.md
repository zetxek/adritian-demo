Welcome to the demo blog. You can customize (or remove) this section in the `_index.md` file in the `blog` folder. You can [read about how to organize content in Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) in the official docs.

The posts below are in the same folder (`blog/`) and can be in the [supported formats by hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/) (Markdown, HTML, Emacs Org Mode, AsciiDoc, Pandoc, or reStructuredText).

You can use translations as well.
